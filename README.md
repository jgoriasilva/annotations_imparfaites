# The impact of imperfect training data on Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository is the code I developed to test the impact of using imperfectly annotated data to train a convolutional neural network (U-Net). It is part of a research project I did during my Master's degree at Mines Paris - Universit√© PSL, in Paris, France.

It contains code to generate synthetic data, the U-Net model using TensorFlow, as well as the logs and results of the research project.

# Contact information

I'm glad to discuss about this project with anyone interest in it. Feel free to send me a message at `jgoriasilva@gmail.com` for more details.
